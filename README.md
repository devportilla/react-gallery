# react-gallery

This is a simple project i made for the people at [LetGo](https://es.letgo.com/es). As this was my first time doing
anything with ReactJs i enjoyed it a lot, so maybe ill keep it going. Visual style credits goes to [this](http://followingfishies.com/)
person im not so good at creating interfaces :sweat:

I used [this](https://github.com/mvader/react-es6-webpack-karma-boilerplate) boilerplate to get things running earlier.

# Installation

Just the usual,
``npm-install``
at the root of the project and enjoy.

### Available commands
``npm start``starts a local server with webpack</br>
``npm test``runs the test suite</br>
``npm run lint``checks code style</br>
``npm build``builds the project with dist options</br>
``test_watch``launches a karma watcher to run the test on every file change


# Todo

- More tests. Services and models are untested.
- Error handling for the external services.
- Refactor the scss part.
